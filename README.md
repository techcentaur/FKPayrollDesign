# FKPayrollDesign
Programming assignment as part of the one week mandatory training at my Flipkart internship assessment.

## Idea
Idea is to create a service that would roll out payment to employees working with different schemes (freelancing, part-time, remote, hourly) at a company.
Employees can be registered, added into unions, unions can be charged; all the basic features in any corporate sector payroll mechanics in a nutshell.
